The set of parts of a system is essential for achieving the objectives in measurement systems. There is a great diversity of materials with different compositions; for this reason, people need to group them. %\citep{crisci1977clasificacion}.
A classification system's objective is to group objects into classes based on the attributes they have in common. Therefore, the design of classification systems seeks an efficient detection of these attributes. For the classification of plastics, systems need to be able to distinguish between recyclable and non-recyclable plastics.
By grouping the different plastic resins in real-time, it must-have elements that detect the events that characterize each plastic. The obtaining comes from transducers, sensors, and the sorting systems interpreted with mathematical models. Proper harmony between the elements provides speeds equal to or greater than three bottles per second. %\citep{crisci1983introduccion}.
This work addresses a brief description of the classification systems for recyclable plastics and their tendency to increase detection speed.

\section{Introduction}

%For Original Research Articles \citep{conference}, Clinical Trial Articles \citep{article}, and Technology Reports \citep{patent}, the introduction should be succinct, with no subheadings \citep{book}. For Case Reports the Introduction should include symptoms at presentation \citep{chapter}, physical exams and lab results \citep{dataset}.

%-impacto económico de la actividad 

The growth of the world population contributes to the increase of solid materials, both those that can be recycled and not recycled. The proper classification of plastics represents an economic activity for individuals and companies contributing to collecting, transferring, and processing different materials.\citep{IMCC2019}, \citep{INEGI2020}.
The generated waste in one year is more than 44 million tons in Mexico, and the figure is expected to increase to 65 million by 2030. Recycled plastics are widely used materials globally. Only 5{\%} is recycled or recovered in Mexico, which would be equivalent to about 2.2 million tons per year \citep{SEMARNAT2019}.
%########################################
Commercially some companies manufacture and distribute sorting systems, see Table \ref{Sistemas}, like the BottleSort \textit{BottleSort} system. This system can identify transparent PET from green PET \citep{Milgrom1994}, \citep{Bruno2000}. The \textit{Poly-Sort} system, similar to BottleSort, begins by separating the bottles in order individually \citep{Bruno2000}, \citep{Association2008}. Another automatic system for the separation of plastic resins is Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy. This identification method works with two filters \citep{Scott1995156}, \citep{Masoumi2012}. Another system lies in x-ray reflection and transmission; it is similar to the infrared spectroscopic method and the VS-2 system with an efficient detection capacity \citep{Bruno2000}, \citep{Foundation2015}.
%-hasta donde esta el estado del arte

Classification systems show a trend in methods using the principle of image processing that uses combinations of various techniques such as principal component analysis, spectroscopy \citep{Rani2019}, and Hough transforms \citep{Duda197211}, \citep{Prasad2012}. Another technique used to classify plastic bottles by extracting their characteristics in the image's intensity is the support vector machine (SVM) \citep{Nawrocky2010}. The author in \citep{Shahbudin2010} can also find an approximation of the containers with morphological operations to describe the image's structure or shape. The methods need to be developed in intelligent machines that classify the bottles in real-time; for example, a system was implemented using an FPGA in \citep{House2011}.
Other systems are based on neural networks in conjunction with infrared spectroscopy to identify plastics efficiently \citep{THuthFehre1995}. Each of the described methods uses different classification tools that provide advantages and disadvantages. See Table \ref{Comparacion}; therefore, they reference the trend in implementing a high-speed classification system. 
%-alusión al objetivo sin mencionar el método
Each commercially available classification method and current methods have different characteristics, designs, and implementation costs \citep{HuiWang201975}, \citep{Association2008}.

The correct classification of different plastic resins maintains a high value in the market; for this reason, it is a research subject, and automatic methods for classifying plastic bottles have been proposed.
Machine learning has been used in the last nine years, thus being a set of automatic learning classification algorithms based on statistical learning theory; this modality can be understood as algorithms that learn from the data entered by a person \citep{1527552} and are implemented in various applications.
Figure \ref{Ejemplo} shows the complete classification process with a feedback system \citep{Association2008}. Various system designs differ from the one shown.
The large number of plastic bottles generated in the world require systems that detect the containers' properties and discard other materials at high speed. Some companies manufacture and distribute classification systems, see Table \ref{Sistemas} as the BottleSort system that detects any material that does not meet a specific size. The system removes contaminants in its first stage, and then a pneumatic system is activated to separate the bottles and place them on a high-speed conveyor belt. The conveyor belt carries the bottles to a 16 infrared detection unit and processes more than 5,000 readings per second. The classification of the resins is done in less than five milliseconds. After identification, the bottle is transported to the location placed in a container, and the bottle is expelled by air. This system can identify transparent PET from green PET \cite{Milgrom1994}, \cite{Bruno2000}.
The Poly-Sort system, similar to BottleSort, begins by separating the bottles in order individually. In this case, the bottles go through a vibration system that removes contaminants. With near-infrared sensors, each bottle is read at a speed of 15 times per second, in less than 19 milliseconds. A color camera and a strobe light allow color identification. If a material is not identified, it is taken to a container at the end of the band \cite{Bruno2000}, \cite{Association2008}.
Another automatic system for the separation of plastic resins is Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy. This identification method consists of two filters and can distinguish between PET, HDPE, PVC, PP, and PS \cite{Scott1995156}. Filters allow distinguishing between labels and lids, but it is not suitable for identifying dark colors see Figure \ref{NIR5}. The biggest problem with the two-filter method is limiting the wavelength region of the light and acquiring the data obtained employing two photodiodes \cite{Masoumi2012}, such as Indium-Gallium-Arsenide.
Another classification option lies in x-ray reflection and transmission; it is similar to the infrared spectroscopic method. The separation consists of the entry of plastic, and through waves, the response of the object is studied. In this case, the transmission and reflection consider the spectrum of the x-rays. This method is highly recommended if the researcher wants to detect PVC. Similarly, the VS-2 system has a capacity of 200 analyzes per second and classifies from 2 to 3 bottles per second \cite{Bruno2000}, \cite{Foundation2015}.  
Most of the techniques that prevail for the classification of plastics rely on the Near-Infrared spectroscopy method because each type of plastic has a wavelength absorbed in its spectra, which can be analyzed to determine the type of plastic \cite{House2011}, \cite{Safavi20102216}.

Recent research suggests new methods such as the principle of image processing see Figure \ref{NIR4} using combinations of various techniques such as principal component analysis, spectroscopy \citep{Rani2019}, and Hough transforms \citep{Duda197211}. One of the limitations of this method is the conditions when taking the picture, the variation in light, resolution, background, and the camera's distance to obtain an accuracy greater than 95 {$ \% $} \citep{Prasad2012}.
Some of these systems are based on the multiple correlation method for PET and non-PET bottle classification. Photos are taken, and the correlation of each PET bottle's image is calculated from histograms of the colors red, green, and blue see Figure \ref{NIR3}. The test uses 200 images of plastic bottles, 100 images of PET bottles, and 100 images of bottles other than PET, with identification results 93.33 {$ \% $} \citep{Srigul2016}, in \citep{Ramli2008}, it is proposed to convert the images to grayscale. The image's main characteristics are extracted, ending with the Linear discriminant analysis method (LDA) obtaining a pressure of 97.5 {$ \% $}. These methods allow discriminating the bottles with different colors \citep{Wang2019170}, \citep{Scavino2009794}.
Another technique used to classify plastic bottles is by extracting their characteristics in the image's intensity, and they are detected with a support vector machine. Its focus is on rotation, translation, and invariant scaling because it uses features derived from image histograms. The method is robust to the factors of bottle size, shape, label types, and deformation. The system achieves an accuracy above 96 {$ \% $} using grayscale images from the camera \citep{Nawrocky2010}.
The researcher can also approximate the packages with morphological operations to describe the image's structure or shape. Using the two-dimensional description of the silhouette of the plastic bottles, the detection of the edge of the silhouettes of the objects is developed by the process of erosion, as well as the process of extraction of characteristics of the vector using SVM and is used to classify the image of two groups. As a result, a performance of more than 90 {$ \% $} precision is obtained \citep{Shahbudin2010}.
%(Shahbudin et al., 2010)
A system that classifies bottles in real-time using FPGA was proposed in \citep{House2011}. The method proposes identifying two types of materials: PET and tetra pack bottles at high speed in real-time, automatically locating the regions with the highest probability that contain these materials within the image and removing the image's background. A histogram is created for the extraction of image features and was used to classify the bottles using SVM. The method has 93 {$ \% $} recognition and is capable of speed. Other systems are based on neural networks in conjunction with infrared spectroscopy for efficient identification of plastics \citep{THuthFehre1995}. Each of the methods described uses machine learning in the same way; they provide advantages and disadvantages see Table \ref{Comparacion}.

We could say that there are currently two ways to classify the different types of plastics: individualized feeding systems that require the objects to be fed to a network of sensors that pass one by one, and massive feeding systems that require the flow of solids are spread out on a conveyor belt. These two systems require that the bottles pass through the measuring system more than once. Each of the classification methods under investigation has different capabilities and costs. Systems that detect bottle size and have the highest speeds use a more significant number of infrared sensors but do not notice the type of label, cap, waste inside the bottle. Systems that consider the bottle's kind of color order them individually, making the system slower and using infrared sensors. Others rely on the frequency of a strobe light to improve the detection of plastics. 
When working with x-rays, the system obtained higher speeds, but it works efficiently only with PVC materials. The trend is inclined to systems that use the near-Infrared spectroscopy method. See Figure \ref{NIR1} because it can detect a great variety of plastics and limit the wavelength active region. Figure \ref{NIR2} shows that when considering the type of color, the wavelengths tend to be linear, making it more difficult to detect the type of plastic; hence, other methods work together, such as image processing, solve this limiting.
